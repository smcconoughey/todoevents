# Street-Level Address Requirement Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a requirement for new events to have street-level address detail while keeping search functionality flexible.

## What Changed

### üé® Frontend Validation
**File:** `frontend/src/components/EventMap/CreateEventForm.jsx`

- Added `isStreetLevelAddress()` function that validates addresses have street numbers and names
- Added real-time validation with visual indicators (green ‚úÖ for valid, amber ‚ö†Ô∏è for incomplete)
- Added helpful guidance text: *"Please provide a specific street address (e.g., '123 Main Street') rather than just a city name"*
- Integrated validation into form submission to prevent invalid addresses

### üîß Backend Validation
**File:** `backend/backend.py` - `EventBase` model

- Added `@validator('address')` decorator that enforces street-level detail server-side
- Uses regex patterns to detect street indicators (numbers + street types)
- Rejects city-only addresses like "Los Angeles, CA" or "Springfield, IL"
- Provides helpful error message to guide users

## Examples

### ‚úÖ **VALID Addresses** (Will be accepted)
- `123 Main Street, Anytown, CA`
- `456 Oak Ave, Springfield, NY 12345` 
- `789 Elm Boulevard, Downtown, TX`
- `321 Sunset Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90210`
- `42 Broadway, New York, NY`

### ‚ùå **INVALID Addresses** (Will be rejected)
- `Los Angeles, CA` *(city only)*
- `New York City` *(city only)*
- `Springfield, IL` *(city only)*
- `Denver, Colorado, USA` *(city only)*
- `Orange County` *(region only)*

## Technical Details

### Validation Logic
The validation looks for:
1. **Street patterns**: Numbers followed by street names/types (St, Ave, Blvd, etc.)
2. **Not city-only**: Rejects common city-only patterns

### Dual Protection
- **Frontend**: Real-time feedback and prevention
- **Backend**: Server-side enforcement for security

### Search Unaffected
- The `/events` endpoint (search/listing) has NO address validation
- Users can still search with any level of detail: city, region, or specific address
- Only **event creation** and **event editing** require street-level addresses

## User Experience

### Before Submission
- Real-time visual feedback as user types address
- Clear guidance text explaining requirement
- Green indicator when address meets requirements

### During Submission
- Frontend prevents submission of invalid addresses
- Backend provides clear error messages if validation fails

### Search Experience
- Completely unchanged - users can search with any address detail level
- Can search by "San Francisco" or "123 Main St" - both work fine

## Benefits

1. **Better Event Discovery**: Attendees get precise locations rather than vague city names
2. **Improved Navigation**: Easier for users to actually find events
3. **Quality Control**: Prevents low-quality event entries with insufficient location data
4. **Flexible Search**: Search functionality remains user-friendly for any detail level

## Testing

Comprehensive testing confirmed:
- ‚úÖ Frontend validation works correctly
- ‚úÖ Backend validation enforces server-side
- ‚úÖ Search functionality unaffected
- ‚úÖ Valid addresses accepted, invalid addresses rejected
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages guide users

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/EventMap/CreateEventForm.jsx` - Frontend validation
2. `backend/backend.py` - Backend validation 
3. `backend/test_address_validation.py` - Test suite (can be deleted after verification)

## Migration Impact

- **Existing events**: No changes required - addresses remain as-is
- **New events**: Must meet street-level requirement
- **Event editing**: Existing events can be edited, but address must meet new requirement
- **Search/API**: No impact on existing search or API functionality
