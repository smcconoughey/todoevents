# TodoEvents Deployment Update

We've identified and fixed several issues with the application's deployment:

## Issues Fixed

1. **Login Error**: Fixed a bug in the login endpoint that was causing the "generator didn't stop after throw()" error.

2. **Admin User Creation**: Improved the admin user creation process with better error handling and fallback mechanisms.

3. **Dependencies**: Added direct `bcrypt` dependency to ensure proper password hashing.

## How to Update Your Deployment

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

If your Render service is connected to GitHub:

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Go to the Render dashboard and click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Clear build cache & deploy"

### Option 2: Direct Render Update

If you prefer to update directly in Render:

1. In the Render dashboard, go to your backend service
2. Click "Environment" and ensure your DATABASE_URL is properly configured:
   ```
   postgresql://todoevents_user:9i7NARYK2tVZI6yXXV3gOw644m2SsjuE@dpg-d0od9fbe5dus73avgsk0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/todoevents
   ```

3. Update the backend files by downloading them from GitHub or manually copying
4. Deploy using "Clear build cache & deploy" option

## Default Admin Credentials

The application creates a default admin user on first startup:
- **Email**: admin@todoevents.com
- **Password**: Admin123!

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the Render logs for any specific errors
2. Verify the database connection is working
3. If login issues persist, try restarting the service
