## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (18.x or later)
- Python (3.9 or later)
- PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todoevents.git
   cd todoevents
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```
   
   This will install both frontend and admin dashboard dependencies.

3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn backend:app --reload
   ```

4. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Start the admin dashboard (optional):
   ```bash
   cd admin
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application:
   - Main application: http://localhost:5173
   - Admin dashboard: http://localhost:5174 (if running separately)
   
### Default Admin Account

When the application first starts, it creates a default admin user:
- **Email**: admin@todoevents.com
- **Password**: Admin123!

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Render.com:

### Frontend and Backend
- Main application: See `render.yaml` for configuration details
- Backend API: Deployed separately at `https://todoevents-backend.onrender.com`

### Admin Dashboard (Standalone)
The admin dashboard can be deployed separately:
- See `admin/README.md` for detailed deployment instructions
- Supports Render.com, Vercel, and Netlify
- Configured to connect to the production backend automatically

## Password Requirements

Passwords must meet the following requirements:
- At least 8 characters long
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

## Environment Variables

### Backend
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required for production)
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: JWT token expiration time

### Frontend
- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend API URL
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Google Maps API key for map functionality

## Security Notes

- No API keys are hardcoded in the codebase; all are loaded from environment variables
- Default admin credentials are only created if no admin user exists in the database
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens are used for authentication with proper expiration
- Password reset uses secure verification codes with expiration
- Environment variables examples are provided in `.env.example` files
- Helper scripts and troubleshooting tools have been removed from the codebase
