# SEO Improvements for TodoEvents

## Schema.org Implementation Enhancements

We've implemented comprehensive improvements to our Schema.org structured data implementation to address several SEO issues identified by search engines.

### Fixed Issues

The following Schema.org fields were missing or incomplete in our event pages:

1. **Missing field "url" (in "organizer")** - Added organizer URL to all events
2. **Missing field "offers"** - Added pricing information with availability status
3. **Missing field "image"** - Added share card image URLs for all events
4. **Missing field "eventStatus"** - Set to "EventScheduled" by default
5. **Missing field "performer"** - Added performer information based on host name
6. **Missing field "endDate"** - Added end date/time calculation for events missing this field

### Implementation Details

#### Frontend Changes

- Updated `generateEventSchema()` function in both frontend and beta versions to include all required fields
- Enhanced schema generation to use event data more effectively
- Improved URL generation for events and images
- Added fallback values for missing fields

#### Backend Changes

- Enhanced `generate_event_json_ld()` in `seo_utils.py` to include all required fields
- Updated validation logic in `validate_event_data()` to check for missing fields
- Introduced `populate_production_seo_fields.py` and a scheduled job `run_seo_population` as the single entry point for populating SEO fields
- Removed the `fix_seo_fields.py` startup step; SEO data is populated only through the scheduled job

### Database Updates

The script `populate_production_seo_fields.py` performs the following updates to events:

1. Adds missing organizer URLs
2. Calculates end times for events missing them (defaults to 2 hours after start time)
3. Handles day rollover for events that cross midnight
4. Updates short descriptions for better meta tags

### Testing

The scheduled job handles SEO population automatically. To trigger it manually run:

```bash
python backend/populate_production_seo_fields.py
```

### Future Improvements

- Add more specific performer information when available
- Enhance offer details with ticket information
- Add more specific eventStatus values based on event date
- Implement AggregateRating when we have enough reviews
- Add more detailed location information with opening hours
