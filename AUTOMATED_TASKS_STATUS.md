# TodoEvents Automated Tasks Status

## Current Automated Task Setup (Production Only)

The application has a comprehensive automated task management system that runs **only in production** on Render. The system is disabled in development mode to prevent interference with local testing.

### ü§ñ AutomatedTaskManager Overview

The `AutomatedTaskManager` class handles all background automation with the following architecture:
- **Scheduler**: Uses APScheduler (Advanced Python Scheduler) with BackgroundScheduler
- **Environment Detection**: Only runs in production (`IS_PRODUCTION = True`)
- **Task Monitoring**: Health checks and status tracking for all tasks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and recovery

## üö® Task Monitoring & Alerts

### Health Check Monitoring:
- ‚úÖ **Normal**: Tasks run within expected timeframe
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Warning**: Task hasn't run in 6-8 hours
- ‚ùå **Alert**: Task hasn't run in 8+ hours

### Status Tracking:
Each task maintains status information:
- `status`: "pending", "completed", "failed"
- `last_run`: ISO timestamp of last execution
- `next_run`: Scheduled next execution time

### Logging:
- All task executions are logged with timestamps
- Errors include full stack traces for debugging
- Health checks log system status every hour
