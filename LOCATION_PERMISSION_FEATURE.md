# Location Permission Feature - Recommendations Panel

## ‚úÖ Feature Implementation Complete

The RecommendationsPanel now includes an intelligent location permission popup that enhances recommendation accuracy by using the user's actual GPS location.

## üéØ Key Features

### **Smart Location Detection**
- **Automatic Popup**: Shows location request popup 1.5 seconds after component loads (only on first visit)
- **One-Time Ask**: Uses localStorage to remember if user was already asked - prevents annoying repeat prompts

- **Persistent Storage**: Saves user's location to localStorage for future sessions

### **Beautiful Permission UI**
- **Themed Design**: Matches app's frost/dark themes with proper backdrop blur

### **Visual Location Indicators**
