# Performance Optimization: Bundled Event Data Loading

## Overview

Implemented a major performance optimization that loads view and like counts with the initial events data instead of making separate API requests for each event. This significantly reduces the number of requests and improves initial load performance.

## Changes Made

### Backend (Already Optimized)
- **Events API (`/events`)** already includes `interest_count` and `view_count` in the response
- **Individual Event API (`/events/{id}`)** includes complete interaction data
- Uses `COALESCE` to ensure counts are never null (defaults to 0)

### Frontend Optimizations

#### 1. EventMap Component (`frontend/src/components/EventMap/index.jsx`)
- **Added batchedSync import** to initialize cache with event data
- **Updated fetchEvents()** to populate batchedSync cache with interaction data from main events response
- **Eliminated redundant API calls** for getting individual event counts

#### 2. Event Interaction Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useEventInteraction.js`)
- **Simplified initialization** to use pre-populated cache data
- **Removed individual API calls** for `fetchInterestStatus()` and `fetchEventData()`
- **Added lazy loading** for user-specific interest status (only when user is logged in)
- **Maintains optimistic updates** for instant UI feedback

#### 3. Batched Sync Service (`frontend/src/utils/batchedSync.js`)
- **Added `checkUserInterestStatus()`** method for lazy loading user interest data
- **Enhanced cache initialization** to handle server data properly
- **Added `interestStatusChecked`** field to track when user interest has been determined

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimization
```
Initial Load:
1. GET /events (loads ~50 events)
2. GET /events/{id1}/interest (per event)
3. GET /events/{id2}/interest (per event)
...
50+ individual API calls for interaction data
```

### After Optimization
```
Initial Load:
1. GET /events (loads ~50 events WITH interest_count and view_count)
2. GET /events/{id}/interest (only for user's interest status, only if logged in)

Result: ~50 fewer API calls on initial load
```

### Benefits
- **~90% reduction** in initial API requests for interaction data
- **Faster initial load** - view/like counts appear immediately
- **Better mobile performance** - fewer network requests
- **Reduced server load** - batched data instead of individual requests
- **Maintained real-time feel** - optimistic updates still work perfectly
- **Smarter data fetching** - only check user interest status when needed

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Events Load**: Main `/events` API returns events with `interest_count` and `view_count`
2. **Cache Population**: BatchedSync cache is initialized with this data
3. **Component Initialization**: `useEventInteraction` hook reads from cache
4. **Lazy Interest Check**: User's interest status checked only when needed
5. **Optimistic Updates**: User interactions still update immediately

### Fallback Handling
- **Graceful degradation** if cache data is missing
- **Error handling** for interest status checks
- **Default values** ensure UI never breaks

## Future Enhancements

As noted in the request, this sets up the foundation for more advanced optimizations:
- **Event clustering** for large datasets
- **Pagination** with smart loading
- **Virtual scrolling** for performance at scale
- **Intelligent caching** strategies

## Usage

No changes required for existing components - the optimization is transparent:

```jsx
// This still works exactly the same, but now loads faster
const { interested, interestCount, viewCount, toggleInterest } = useEventInteraction(eventId);
```

The optimization maintains the same "illusion of real-time" experience while dramatically reducing network overhead.
