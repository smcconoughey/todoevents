# Individual Event Creators Guide

## Overview
We've enhanced todo-events with dedicated features and resources for individual event creators - people who want to host small-scale, community-focused events like book clubs, hobby groups, meetups, and local gatherings.

## New Features Added

### 1. **Individual Event Creators Page** (`/creators`)
A dedicated landing page specifically designed for individual event creators with:

- **Empowering messaging** focusing on how anyone can make a difference
- **Benefits section** explaining why individual events matter
- **Success stories** from real people who started small and built communities
- **Feature highlights** showing professional tools available for free
- **Clear call-to-action** to create their first event

#### Key Messaging:
- "Every Event Starts with One Person"
- "You don't need a big budget, corporate backing, or hundreds of followers"
- Focus on passion-driven, authentic community building

### 2. **Enhanced Welcome Experience**
Updated the welcome popup to include two distinct pathways:

- **Individual Events** button â†’ Leads to `/creators` page

This helps users immediately understand which path is right for them and provides tailored information.

### 3. **Improved Navigation Flow**
