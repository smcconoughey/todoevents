# Bulk Import & Event Cleanup Fixes Summary

## 🎉 **ISSUE RESOLVED: Events ARE Being Created Successfully**

After investigation, we discovered that **all events were being created successfully** in the database. The issue was **pagination and visibility**, not event creation failure.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem 1: Pagination Limiting Visibility**
- The `/events` API endpoint had a default limit of 50 events
- Events were sorted by `date ASC, start_time ASC`
- Newly created events with future dates were being pushed beyond the first 50 results
- Users checking https://todoevents-backend.onrender.com/events only saw the first 50 events

### **Problem 2: Cache Issues**
- Event cache wasn't being cleared consistently after bulk import
- Multiple cache keys with different parameters could serve stale data

### **Problem 3: Need for Event Cleanup**
- No automated cleanup system for expired events
- Events past their date needed regular cleanup with 24-hour archive policy

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Pagination Improvements**
```python
# Before: Default limit of 50 events, max 100
limit: Optional[int] = 50,  # Add pagination
limit = min(max(limit or 50, 1), 100)  # Between 1 and 100

# After: Default limit of 100 events, max 200
limit: Optional[int] = 100,  # Increased default limit  
limit = min(max(limit or 100, 1), 200)  # Between 1 and 200
```

### **2. Improved Event Ordering**
```sql
-- Before: Simple chronological order
ORDER BY date ASC, start_time ASC

-- After: Prioritize upcoming events
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN date >= DATE('now') THEN 0  -- Future/today events first
        ELSE 1                           -- Past events later  
    END,
    date ASC, start_time ASC
```

### **3. Enhanced Cache Management**
```python
# Ensured cache clearing after bulk import
if success_count > 0:
    conn.commit()
    # CRITICAL FIX: Clear event cache after bulk import
    event_cache.clear()
    logger.info(f"🧹 Cleared event cache to ensure new events appear in API")
```

### **4. Automated Event Cleanup System**
**Features:**
- ✅ **24-Hour Archive Policy**: Events from yesterday are kept for 24 hours
- ✅ **Safe Deletion**: Events older than 24 hours are automatically cleaned up
- ✅ **Related Data Cleanup**: Removes event interests and views for deleted events
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: All deletions happen in database transactions
- ✅ **Cache Clearing**: Automatically clears caches after cleanup
- ✅ **Scheduler Integration**: Runs automatically every 6 hours

**Cleanup Function:**
```python
async def cleanup_expired_events(self):
    """Enhanced cleanup of expired events with 24-hour archive"""
    # Get current date and 24-hour archive cutoff
    current_date = datetime.now().date()
    archive_cutoff = current_date - timedelta(days=1)  # 24-hour archive
    
    # Find expired events beyond archive period
    # Delete related data first (interests, views)
    # Delete events in transaction
    # Clear caches
    # Log cleanup results
```

**Manual Trigger:**
```bash
# Trigger cleanup manually via API
curl -X POST "https://todoevents-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/automation/trigger/cleanup"
```

## 🧪 **Verification Results**

### **Test Script Results:**
- ✅ **All 6 events found** that were mentioned in logs (IDs: 441-453)
- ✅ **Events ARE in the database** and accessible via individual API calls
- ✅ **Pagination working** - with `limit=100` parameter, API returns 100 events
- ✅ **Cache clearing functional** - automation trigger works correctly
- ✅ **Cleanup system operational** - can be triggered manually

### **Specific Events Verified:**
- ✅ Event 452: Coldplay - Music of the Spheres World Tour
- ✅ Event 453: Mötley Crüe: The Las Vegas Residency  
- ✅ Event 444: Florida International Air Show
- ✅ Event 443: Mötley Crüe: The Las Vegas Residency
- ✅ Event 442: Coldplay - Music of the Spheres World Tour
- ✅ Event 441: Le Grand Cirque Presents ADRENALINE 2.0

## 📊 **API Improvements**

### **Enhanced Events Endpoint:**
- **Default limit increased**: 50 → 100 events
- **Maximum limit increased**: 100 → 200 events  
- **Improved ordering**: Upcoming events prioritized
- **Better cache management**: Consistent clearing after changes

### **Bulk Import Improvements:**
- **Cache clearing**: Events appear immediately after bulk import
- **Enhanced logging**: Better visibility into the import process
- **Error handling**: Improved PostgreSQL RealDictRow handling

## 🔧 **Automation Features**

### **Scheduled Tasks:**
1. **Sitemap Generation**: Every 6 hours
2. **Event Data Refresh**: Every 8 hours  
3. **AI Sync**: Every 6 hours (offset by 4 hours)
4. **Event Cleanup**: Every 6 hours (offset by 3 hours) ← **NEW**

### **Manual Triggers Available:**
```bash
# Available automation endpoints
POST /api/v1/automation/trigger/sitemap
POST /api/v1/automation/trigger/events  
POST /api/v1/automation/trigger/ai_sync
POST /api/v1/automation/trigger/cleanup  ← **NEW**
```

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

1. **Bulk Import Was Working**: Events were being created successfully all along
2. **Pagination Was the Issue**: Default limits were hiding newly created events
3. **Cache Management Critical**: Must clear caches after bulk operations
4. **Cleanup System Essential**: Automated cleanup prevents database bloat
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Verification scripts help diagnose issues quickly

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

### **Immediate Benefits:**
- Users will see more recent events in the main API
- Expired events will be automatically cleaned up
- Database performance will improve over time
- Cache consistency is maintained

### **Long-term Benefits:**
- Reduced database storage costs
- Improved API response times
- Better SEO with updated sitemaps
- Cleaner event listings for users

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. **backend/backend.py**:
   - Enhanced pagination (50→100 default, 100→200 max)
   - Improved event ordering (upcoming events first)
   - Added cache clearing after bulk import
