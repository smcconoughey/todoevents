## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### Step 1: Run the Test Script

```bash
cd backend
python test_stripe_integration.py
```

This will verify:
- Environment variables are set
- Stripe config endpoint works
- Webhook endpoint is accessible
- Checkout session creation works (if you have a test user)

### Step 2: Manual Testing Flow

1. **Go to your TodoEvents app**: `https://your-app.onrender.com`

2. **Create or log into a test account**

3. **Navigate to Account page**: Click your profile → "My Account"

4. **Go to Premium tab**: Click "Upgrade to Premium" in the sidebar

5. **Click the upgrade button**: "Upgrade to Premium - $20/month"

6. **You'll be redirected to Stripe checkout** with:
   - Your email pre-filled
   - $20/month subscription
   - Test mode indicator

7. **Use test payment details**:
   - **Card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
   - **CVC**: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - **ZIP**: Any valid ZIP code

8. **Complete the payment**

9. **You'll be redirected back** with a success message

10. **Verify premium features**:
    - Green "Premium" badge in header
    - Access to Analytics tab
    - Verified event badges (if you have events)

### Step 3: Test Webhook Events

1. **Check your Render logs** for webhook activity:
   ```
   ✅ Premium activated for user X via Stripe payment
   📝 Subscription created for user X
   ```

2. **Check your Stripe dashboard**:
   - Go to Payments → View test payments
   - Go to Subscriptions → View test subscriptions
   - Go to Webhooks → Check delivery logs

### Step 4: Test Cancellation (Optional)

1. **In Stripe dashboard**: Go to test subscription → Cancel subscription
2. **Check logs**: Should see cancellation webhook processing
3. **Verify user**: Should be downgraded from premium back to regular user

## 🔧 Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set in your Render environment:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (your test secret key)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... (your test publishable key)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (from webhook endpoint)
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_... (your $20/month price)
```

## 📊 What to Monitor

### In Render Logs:
- `✅ Created checkout session for user X`
- `🔔 Received Stripe webhook: checkout.session.completed`
- `✅ Premium activated for user X via Stripe payment`
- `✅ Premium notification email sent to user@email.com`

### In Stripe Dashboard:
- Test payments appearing
- Webhook events being delivered successfully
- Subscriptions being created

### In Your App:
- User role changes from "user" to "premium"
- Premium badge appears in UI
- Analytics tab becomes available
- Success messages display correctly

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Payment system is not configured yet"
**Solution**: Check that all environment variables are set in Render

### Issue: "Failed to create checkout session"
**Solution**: Check Render logs for specific Stripe API errors

### Issue: "Webhook signature verification failed"
**Solution**: Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches your Stripe dashboard

### Issue: Payment succeeds but user not upgraded
**Solution**: Check webhook delivery in Stripe dashboard and Render logs

### Issue: User redirected but no success message
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and check URL parameters

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### ✅ Happy Path Testing:
1. New user signs up → upgrades to premium → gets all features
2. Premium user creates events → sees analytics → events are verified
3. Monthly renewal → subscription continues → user stays premium

### ⚠️ Edge Case Testing:
1. Payment fails → user stays on regular plan
2. User cancels → payment → should return to account page
3. Webhook delivery fails → should retry automatically
4. User already premium → tries to upgrade again

### 🔄 Subscription Lifecycle Testing:
1. **Creation**: New subscription via checkout
2. **Renewal**: First monthly payment (test in 1 month)
3. **Pause**: Admin pauses subscription
4. **Resume**: Admin resumes subscription  
5. **Cancel**: User or admin cancels
