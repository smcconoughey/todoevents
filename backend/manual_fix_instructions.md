# Manual Fix for Event 1444 Image Data Issue

## Problem
Event 1444 has uploaded images (accessible via direct URL) but the database records show `banner_image: null` and `logo_image: null`.

## Root Cause
The database UPDATE queries during image upload either failed silently or were rolled back due to a transaction issue.

## Images Confirmed to Exist
- Banner: `banner_1444_34c15187579547a9b828c89c9d543198.jpg` âœ… (accessible at https://todoevents-backend.onrender.com/uploads/banners/banner_1444_34c15187579547a9b828c89c9d543198.jpg)
- Logo: Need to check the upload logs or test if file exists

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use the Admin Panel (Recommended)
1. Log into the admin dashboard
2. Go to Event Management section
3. Find event 1444 ("Test" event)
4. Edit the event and manually set:
   - Banner Image: `banner_1444_34c15187579547a9b828c89c9d543198.jpg`
   - Logo Image: `logo_1444_[hash].jpg` (if it exists)

### Option 2: Direct Database Fix (For Production Admin)
Run this SQL on the production PostgreSQL database:

```sql
-- Update event 1444 with correct image filenames
UPDATE events 
SET banner_image = 'banner_1444_34c15187579547a9b828c89c9d543198.jpg'
WHERE id = 1444;

-- Verify the update
SELECT id, title, banner_image, logo_image 
FROM events 
WHERE id = 1444;
```

### Option 3: Re-upload the Images
1. Delete the current uploaded files (if possible)
2. Re-upload the banner and logo images through the event creation form
3. This should trigger the upload process again with proper database updates

## Long-term Fix
The upload process needs to be debugged to prevent this issue from happening again. The problem likely lies in:

1. **Transaction handling**: The file upload succeeds but database commit fails
2. **Error handling**: Silent failures in the UPDATE query
3. **Database connection**: Connection issues during the UPDATE operation

## Verification Steps
After applying the fix:

1. Check the API response:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://todoevents-backend.onrender.com/events/1444" | jq '{id, title, banner_image, logo_image}'
   ```

2. Check if images display in the event details panel when clicking on the event

3. Verify image accessibility:
   ```bash
   curl -I "https://todoevents-backend.onrender.com/uploads/banners/banner_1444_34c15187579547a9b828c89c9d543198.jpg"
   ```

## Expected Result
After the fix, the event details panel should show:
- The banner image at the top of the panel
- The logo image next to the event title
- Both images should be visible to users viewing the event
