# Mobile Close Button Fix

## Issue
After opening an event link on mobile, users couldn't click the close button to close the event details and return to the main map. The close button would flash but stay open.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Z-index Conflicts**: The mobile bottom sheet had the same z-index (z-40) as other overlay elements, causing layering conflicts
2. **Small Touch Target**: The close button was too small (8x8) for reliable mobile touch interaction
3. **Missing Touch Event Handling**: No explicit touch event prevention for better mobile interaction
4. **No Backdrop Dismissal**: Missing common mobile UX pattern of tapping outside to close

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Z-index for Mobile Bottom Sheet
```javascript
// Changed from z-40 to z-50
className="... z-50 ..."
```

### 2. Enhanced Close Button for Mobile
- Increased button size from `h-8 w-8` to `h-10 w-10` 
- Increased icon size from `h-4 w-4` to `h-5 w-5`
- Added `touch-manipulation` CSS class
- Added explicit event prevention:
```javascript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  handleCloseEventDetails();
}}
onTouchEnd={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
}}
```

### 3. Added Backdrop Overlay for Mobile
- Added backdrop overlay that can be tapped to close modal
- Follows common mobile UX patterns:
```javascript
<div 
  className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/30 sm:hidden z-40"
  onClick={handleCloseEventDetails}
/>
```

### 4. Event Propagation Management
- Added `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` to modal content to prevent accidental closure

## Result
The mobile close button now works reliably with:
- ✅ Proper z-index layering (z-50 for modal, z-40 for backdrop)
- ✅ Larger touch targets for better mobile interaction
- ✅ Explicit touch event handling
- ✅ Backdrop tap-to-close functionality
- ✅ Improved visual feedback and responsiveness

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/EventMap/index.jsx`

## Testing
Test the fix by:
1. Opening the app on mobile or mobile emulator
2. Clicking on any event marker to open details
3. Verifying the close button (X) works properly
4. Verifying tapping outside the modal also closes it
5. Confirming the URL properly returns to `/` when closed
